            <p>DEAR CHARLIE,&mdash;Spring's on us at last, and a
            proper old April we've 'ad,</p>

            <p>Though the cold snap as copped us at Easter made
            'oliday makers feel mad.</p>

            <p>Rum cove that old Clerk o' the Weather; seems
            somehow to take a delight</p>

            <p>In mucking Bank 'Oliday biz; seems as though it was
            out of sheer spite.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>When we're fast with our nose to the grindstone, in
            orfice or fact'ry, or shop,</p>

            <p>The sun bustiges forth a rare bat, till a feller
            feels fair on the 'op;</p>

            <p>But when Easter or Whitsuntide's 'andy, and outings
            all round is in train,</p>

            <p>It is forty to one on a blizzard, or regular buster
            of rain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>It's a orkud old universe, CHARLIE, most things go
            as crooked as Z.</p>

            <p>Feelosophers <i>may</i> think it out, 'ARRY ain't
            got the 'eart, or the 'ead;</p>

            <p>But I 'old the perverse, and permiskus is Nature's
            fust laws, and no kid.</p>

            <p>If it isn't a quid and bad 'ealth, it is always good
            'ealth and <i>no</i> quid!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>'Owsomever it's no use a fretting. I got one good
            outing&mdash;on wheels;</p>

            <p>For I've took to the bicycle, yus,&mdash;and can
            show a good many my 'eels.</p>

            <p>You should see me lam into it, CHARLIE, along a
            smooth bit of straight road,</p>

            <p>And if anyone gets better barney and spree out of
            wheeling, I'm blowed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Larks fust and larks larst is <i>my</i> motter. Old
            RICHARDSON's rumbo is rot.</p>

            <p>Preachy-preachy on 'ealth and fresh hair may be nuts
            to a sanit'ry pot;</p>

            <p>But it isn't mere hexercise, CHARLIE, nor yet pooty
            scenery, and that,</p>

            <p>As'll put 'ARRY's legs on the pelt. No, yours truly
            is not sech a flat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Picktereskness be jolly well jiggered, and as for
            good 'ealth, I've no doubt</p>

            <p>That the treadmill is jolly salubrious, wich that is
            mere turning about,</p>

            <p>Upon planks 'stead o' pedals, my pippin. No,
            wheeling <i>as</i> wheeling's 'ard work,</p>

            <p>And that, without larks, is a speeches of game as I
            always did shirk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>I</i> ain't one o' them skinny shanked saps, with
            a chest 'ollered out, and a 'ump,</p>

            <p>Wot do records on roads for the 'onour, and faint or
            go slap off their chump.</p>

            <p>You don't ketch <i>me</i> straining my 'eart till it
            cracks for a big silver mug.</p>

            <p>No; 'ARRY takes heverythink heasy, and likes to feel
            cosy and snug.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Wy, I knowed a long lathy-limbed josser as felt up
            to champion form.</p>

            <p>And busted hisself to beat records, and took all the
            Wheel-World by storm,</p>

            <p>Went off like candle-snuff, CHARLIE, while stoopin'
            to lace up 'is boot.</p>

            <p>Let them go for <i>that</i> game as are mind to,
            here's one as it certn'y won't soot.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>But there's fun in it, CHARLIE, worked proper, you'd
            'ardly emagine 'ow much,</p>

            <p>If you ain't done a rush six a-breast, and
            skyfoozled some dawdling old Dutch.</p>

            <p>Women don't like us Wheelers a mossel, espech'lly
            the doddering old sort</p>

            <p>As go skeery at row and rumtowzle; but, scrunch it!
            that makes a'rf the sport!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>'Twas a bit of a bother to learn, and I wobbled
            tremenjus at fust,</p>

            <p>Ah! it give me what-for in my jints, and no end of a
            thundering thust;</p>

            <p>I felt jest like a snake with skyattica doubling
            about on the loose,</p>

            <p>As 'elpless as 'ot calf's-foot jelly, old man, and
            about as much use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Now I <i>don't</i> like to look like a juggins, it's
            wot I carn't stand, s'elp my bob;</p>

            <p>But you know I ain't heasy choked off, dear old pal,
            when I'm fair on the job.</p>

            <p>So I spotted a quiet back naybrood, triangle of
            grass and tall trees,</p>

            <p>Good roads, and no bobbies, or carts. Oh, I tell yer
            'twas "go as yer please."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>They call it a "Park," and it's pooty, and quiet as
            Solsberry Plain,</p>

            <p>Or a hold City church on a Sunday, old man, when
            it's welting with rain;</p>

            <p>Old maids, retired gents, sickly jossers, and
            studyus old stodges live there,</p>

            <p>And they didn't like me and my squeaker a mossel;
            but wot did <i>I</i> care.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>When they wentured a mild remonstration, I chucked
            'em a smart bit o' lip,</p>

            <p>With a big D or two&mdash;for the ladies&mdash;and
            wosn't they soon on the skip!</p>

            <p>'Twos my own 'appy 'unting ground, CHARLIE, until I
            could fair feel my feet;</p>

            <p>If you want to try wheels, take the Park; I am sure
            it'll do you a treat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I did funk the danger, at fust; but these Safeties
            don't run yer much risk,</p>

            <p>And arter six weeks in the Park, I could treadle
            along pooty brisk;</p>

            <p>And <i>then</i> came the barney, my bloater! I jined
            'arf a dozen prime pals,</p>

            <p>And I tell you we now are the dread of our parts,
            and espessh'lly the gals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>No Club, mate, for me; that means money, and rules,
            sportsman form, and sech muck.</p>

            <p>I likes to pick out my own pals, go permiskus, and
            trust to pot-luck.</p>

            <p>A rush twelve-a-breast <i>is</i> a gammock, twelve
            squeakers a going like one;</p>

            <p>But "rules o' the road" dump you down, chill yer
            sperrits, and spile all the fun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The "Charge o' the Light Brigade," CHARLIE? Well,

            loose, and a-chargin' down 'ill?</p>

            <p>Dash, dust-clouds, wheel-whizz, whistles, squeakers,
            our 'owls, women's shrieks, and men's swears!</p>

            <p>Oh, I tell yer it's 'Ades let loose, or all Babel a

        </div>

        <div class="stanza">

            <i>my</i> form by a lot.</p>

            <p>Don't I jest discumfuddle the donas, and bosh the
            old buffers as prowl</p>

            <p>Along green country roads at their ease, till
            they're scared by my squeak, or my 'owl?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>My "alarm" <i>is</i> a caution I tell yer; it sounds

            yer a twist in the jaw,</p>

            <p>And a pain in the 'ed when you 'ear it. I laugh till
            I shake in my socks</p>

            <p>When I turn it on sharp on old gurls and they jump

        <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>nervously</i>). Now are we really
        protected from disturbance?</p>

        <p><i>General in Command of Troops.</i> I think so. The
        Court House is surrounded by an Army Corps, and the
        Engineers find that the place has not been undermined to at
        least a distance of a thousand feet.</p>

        <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>somewhat reassured</i>). Well, now I

        <p><i>Prisoner.</i> Good morning. (<i>To</i> Judge.) You
        can resume your hat.</p>

        <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>bowing to the</i> Prisoner). Accused, I
        am deeply honoured by your courtesy. I trust you have been
        comfortable in the State apartments that have been recently
        supplied to you.</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>firmly</i>). State apartment! Why it
        was a prison! You know it, <i>M. le Juge</i>, and you,
        Gentlemen of the Jury and Witnesses. (<i>The entire
        audience shudder apprehensively.</i>) And, what is more, my
        friends outside know it! They know that I was arrested and
        thrown into prison. Yes, they know that, and will act
        accordingly.</p>

        <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>tearfully</i>). I am sure none of us
        wished to offend you!</p>

        <p><i>Members of the Bar</i> (<i>in a breath</i>).
        Certainly not!</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner.</i> Well, let the trial proceed. I suppose
        you don't want any evidence. You have heard what I have
        said. You know that I regret having caused inconvenience to
        my innocent victims. They would forgive me for my innocent
        intentions. I only wished to save everybody by blowing
        everybody up.</p>

        <p><i>The Court generally.</i> Yes, yes!</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner.</i> Well, I have just done. And now what
        say the Jury? Where are they?</p>

        <p><i>Foreman of the Jury</i> (<i>white with fear</i>). I
        am, Sir,&mdash;very pleased to see you, Sir,&mdash;hope you
        are well, Sir?</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>condescendingly</i>). Tol lol. And
        now what do you say? am I Guilty or Not Guilty?</p>

        <p><i>Foreman of the Jury.</i> Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir. We
        will talk it over, Sir&mdash;if you don't mind, Sir.</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner.</i> I need not tell you that my friends
        outside take the greatest possible interest in your
        proceedings.</p>

        <p><i>Foreman</i> (<i>promptly</i>). Why, yes, Sir! The
        fact is we have all had anonymous letters daily, saying
        that we shall be blown out of house and home if we harm
        you.</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Oh, be under no
        apprehension. It is merely the circular of my friends. Only
        a compilation of hints for the guidance of the Gentlemen of
        the Jury.</p>

        <p><i>Foreman.</i> Just so, Sir. We accepted it in that
        spirit.</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner.</i> You were wise. Now, Gentlemen, you have
        surely had time to make up your minds. Do you find me
        Guilty or Not Guilty?</p>

        <p><i>Foreman</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). Why, Not Guilty, to
        be sure.</p>

        <p><i>Judge.</i> Release the accused! Sir, you have my
        congratulations. Pray accept my distinguished
        consideration.</p>

        <p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>coldly</i>). You are very good. And
        now adieu, and off to breakfast with what appetite ye
        may!</p>

        <p><i>The Entire Court</i> (<i>falling on their knees, and

        pity's sake, mercy!</p>

        I have been arrested! Mercy! after I have been cast into
        gaol!</p>

        <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>in tears.</i>) They thought they were
        right. They were, doubtless, wrong, but it was to save the
        remainder of the row of houses! Can you not consider this a
        plea for extenuating circumstances?</p>

        <p><i>Ex-Prisoner</i> (<i>sternly</i>). No. It was my
        business, not theirs. It was I who paid for the
        dynamite&mdash;not they. (<i>Preparing to leave the
        Court.</i>) Good bye. You may hear from me and from my
        friends!</p>

        stay! See us&mdash;we kneel to you. (<i>To audience.</i>)
        Kneel, friends, kneel! (<i>Everybody obeys the

        have Mothers! I knew not this. I pardon you! [<i>The

    <h2>THE YOUNG GIRL'S COMPANION.</h2>

    <h4><i>By Mrs. Payley.</i></h4>

    <h3>III.&mdash;THE CHOICE OF A POSE.</h3>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/225.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/225.png"
             alt="Young girl, posing." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>All young girls should have definite ideas of the impression
    which they wish to create. The natural girl is always either
    impolite or impolitic. I am quite willing to allow that a girl
    who appears artificial is equally detestable. To be unnatural,
    and to appear natural, is the end at which the young girl
    should aim. Much, then, will depend on the choice of a pose. It
    should be suitable; there should be something in your
    appearance and abilities to support the illusion. I once knew a
    fat girl, with red hair (the <i>wrong</i> red), &amp; good
    appetite, and chilblains on her fingers; she adopted the
    romantic pose, and made herself ridiculous; of course, she was
    quite unable to look the part. If she had done the Capital
    Housekeeper, or the Cheerfully Philanthropic, she might have
    married a middle-aged Rector. She threw away her chances by
    choosing an unsuitable pose. At the same time the reasons for
    your choice should never be obvious. There was another case,
    which amused me slightly&mdash;a dark girl, with fine eyes. She
    was originally intended to be a beauty, but she had some
    accident in her childhood that had crippled her. She had to
    walk with a stick, and her back was bent. She posed as a
    man-hater. The part suited her well enough, for she had rather
    a pretty wit. "But," I said to her, "it is too plainly a case
    of the fox and the grapes; you hate men because you are a
    cripple, and can never get a man to love you." She did not take
    this friendly hint at all nicely; in fact, since then she has
    never spoken to me again; but what I said to her was quite
    true. She was right in deciding that she had nothing to do with
    love; if you ever have to buy yourself a wooden leg, you may as
    well get a wooden heart at the same time. But her pose was too
    obvious&mdash;ridiculously obvious. She would have done better
    with something in the way of a religious
    enthusiasm&mdash;something very mystical. It would have been
    impressive.</p>

    <p>In the matter of dress a girl can do very much towards
    supporting her pose; but she must have the intuitions and
    perceptions of an artist.</p>

    <p>The child-like type requires great care, for the young girl
    in London is not naturally child-like. There should be a
    suggestion of untidiness about the hair; the dress should be
    simple, loose and sashed; nurse a kitten with a blue ribbon
    round its neck; say that you like chocolate-creams; open your
    eyes very wide, and suck the tip of one finger occasionally.
    Let your manner generally vary between the pensive and the
    mischievous; always ask for explanations, especially of things
    which cannot possibly be explained in public. Do not attempt
    this pose unless your figure is <i>mignon</i> and your
    complexion pink. Do not be <i>too</i> realistic; never be
    sticky or dirty&mdash;men do not care for it.</p>

    <p>A capital pose for a girl with dark lines under the eyes, is
    that of "the girl-with-a-past." These lines, which are mostly
    the result of liver, are commonly accepted as evidence of soul.
    The dress should be sombre, trailing, and rather distraught:
    there is a way of arranging a <i>fichu</i> which of itself
    suggests that the heart beneath it is blighted. If you happen
    to possess a few ornaments which are not too expensive,
    distribute them among your girl-friends; say, in a repressed
    voice, that you do not care for such things any more. Let it be
    known that there is one day in the year which you prefer to
    spend in complete solitude. Have a special affection for one
    flower; occasionally allow your emotions to master you when you
    hear music. The hair-ornament belongs exclusively to the lower
    middle-classes, but wear one article of jewellery, a souvenir,
    which either never opens or never comes off. Smile sometimes,
    of course; but be careful to smile unnaturally. On all festive
    occasions divide your time between your bedroom and the
    churchyard.</p>

    <p>Both these types demand some personal attractions; if you
    have no personal attractions, you must fall back upon one of
    the philanthropical types. The plainer you are, the more rigid
    will be your philanthropy. Your object will be to disseminate
    in the homes of the poor some of the luxuries of the rich; and,
    on returning, to disseminate in the homes of the rich some of
    the diseases of the poor. Everything about you must be flat;
    your hats, hair and heels must be flat; your denials must be
    particularly flat. Always take your meals in your jacket and a
    hurry, never with the rest of your family; never have time to
    eat enough, but always have time to brag about it.</p>

    <p>I cannot understand why any girl should object to the
    assumption of a pose; and yet a girl told me the other day that
    she preferred to be what she seemed to be. She was an
    exceptional case; I disbelieved in her protestations that she
    was perfectly natural, and managed to get some opportunities
    for observation when she did not know that she was observed. I
    must own that she was quite truthful; she also managed to get
    married&mdash;suburban happiness and no position&mdash;but, as
    I said, she was exceptional. Personally, I feel sure that I
    should never have been married if I had seemed to be what I
    really was. I cannot understand this desire to be
    natural&mdash;it <i>is</i> so affected.</p>

    <p>My correspondence this week is not very interesting. In
    spite of my disclaimer last week, I have been asked several
    questions which are not connected with Sentiment and Propriety.
    "BELLADONNA" asks my advice on rather a delicate case; she is
    almost engaged to a man, A., and her greatest friend is a girl,
    B. Happening, the other day, to open B.'s Diary by mistake for
    her own, she discovered that B. is also very much in love with
    A. What is "BELLADONNA" to do? I think the most honourable
    course would be to report in her own Diary a statement by A.
    that he loathes B., and then leave the Diary where B. might
    mistake it for her own. This is checkmate for B., because she
    cannot do anything nasty without thereby implying that she has
    read "BELLADONNA's" Diary.</p>

        book, "one of my powerful and fascinating stories of life
        in modern Wessex. It is well known, of course, that
        although I often write agricultural novels, I invariably
        call a spade a spade, and not an agricultural implement.

        misdoings, and their undoings. Unstrained dialect is a
        speciality. If you want to know the extent of Wessex,
        consult histories of the Heptarchy with maps."]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <p>In our beautiful Blackmoor or Blakemore Vale, not far from
    the point where the Melchester Road turns sharply towards
    Icenhurst on its way to Wintoncester, having on one side the
    hamlet of Batton, on the other the larger town of Casterbridge,
    stands the farmhouse wherewith in this narrative we have to
    deal. There for generations had dwelt the rustic family of the
    PEEPS, handing down from father to son a well-stocked cow-shed
    and a tradition of rural virtues which yet excluded not an
    overgreat affection on the male side for the home-brewed ale
    and the homemade language in which, as is known, the Wessex
    peasantry delights. On this winter morning the smoke rose
    thinly into the still atmosphere, and faded there as though
    ashamed of bringing a touch of Thermidorean warmth into a
    degree of temperature not far removed from the zero-mark of the
    local Fahrenheit. Within, a fire of good Wessex logs crackled
    cheerily upon the hearth. Old ABRAHAM PEEP sat on one side of
    the fireplace, his figure yet telling a tale of former vigour.
    On the other sat POLLY, his wife, an aimless, neutral,
    slatternly peasant woman, such as in these parts a man may find
    with the profusion of Wessex blackberries. An empty chair
    between them spoke with all an empty chair's eloquence of an
    absent inmate. A butter-churn stood in a corner next to an
    ancient clock that had ticked away the mortality of many a past
    and gone PEEP.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/226.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/226.png"
             alt="Bonduca Peep." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Where be BONDUCA?" said ABRAHAM, shifting his body upon his
    chair so as to bring his wife's faded tints better into view.
    "Like enough she's met in with that slack-twisted 'hor's bird
    of a feller, TOM TATTERS. And she'll let the sheep draggle
    round the hills. My soul, but I'd like to baste 'en for a poor
    slammick of a chap."</p>

    <p>Mrs. PEEP smiled feebly. She had had her troubles. Like
    other realities, they took on themselves a metaphysical mantle
    of infallibility, sinking to minor cerebral phenomena for quiet
    contemplation. She had no notion how they did this. And, it
    must be added, that they might, had they felt so disposed, have
    stood as pressing concretions which chafe body and soul&mdash;a
    most disagreeable state of things, peculiar to the miserably
    passive existence of a Wessex peasant woman.</p>

    <p>"BONDUCA went early," she said, adding, with a weak
    irrelevance. "She mid 'a' had her pick to-day. A mampus o' men
    have bin after her&mdash;fourteen of 'em, all the best lads
    round about, some of 'em wi' bags and bags of gold to their
    names, and all wanting BONDUCA to be their lawful wedded
    wife."</p>

    <p>ABRAHAM shifted again. A cunning smile played about the hard
    lines of his face. "POLLY," he said, bringing his closed fist
    down upon his knee with a sudden violence, "you pick the
    richest, and let him carry BONDUCA to the pa'son. Good looks
    wear badly, and good characters be of no account; but the
    gold's the thing for us. Why," he continued, meditatively, "the
    old house could be new thatched, and you and me live like Lords
    and Ladies, away from the mulch o' the barton, all in silks and
    satins, wi' golden crowns to our heads, and silver buckles to
    our feet."</p>

    <p>POLLY nodded eagerly. She was a Wessex woman born, and
    thoroughly understood the pure and unsophisticated nature of
    the Wessex peasant.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>Meanwhile BONDUCA PEEP&mdash;little BO PEEP was the name by
    which the country-folk all knew her&mdash;sat dreaming upon the
    hill-side, looking out with a premature woman's eyes upon the
    rich valley that stretched away to the horizon. The rest of the
    landscape was made up of agricultural scenes and incidents
    which the slightest knowledge of Wessex novels can fill in
    amply. There were rows of swedes, legions of dairymen, maidens
    to milk the lowing cows that grazed soberly upon the rich
    pasture, farmers speaking rough words of an uncouth dialect,
    and gentlefolk careless of a milkmaid's honour. But nowhere, as
    far as the eye could reach, was there a sign of the sheep that
    Bo had that morning set forth to tend for her parents. Bo had a
    flexuous and finely-drawn figure not unreminiscent of many a
    vanished knight and dame, her remote progenitors, whose dust
    now mouldered in many churchyards. There was about her an
    amplitude of curve which, joined to a certain luxuriance of
    moulding, betrayed her sex even to a careless observer. And
    when she spoke, it was often with a fetishistic utterance in a
    monotheistic falsetto which almost had the effect of startling
    her relations into temporary propriety.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>Thus she sat for some time in the suspended attitude of an
    amiable tiger-cat at pause on the edge of a spring. A rustle
    behind her caused her to turn her head, and she saw a strange
    procession advancing over the parched fields where&mdash;[Two
    pages of field-scenery omitted.&mdash;ED.] One by one they
    toiled along, a far-stretching line of women sharply defined
    against the sky. All were young, and most of them haughty and
    full of feminine waywardness. Here and there a coronet sparkled
    on some noble brow where predestined suffering had set its
    stamp. But what most distinguished these remarkable
    processionists in the clear noon of this winter day was that
    each one carried in her arms an infant. And each one, as she
    reached the place where the enthralled BONDUCA sat obliviscent
    of her sheep, stopped for a moment and laid the baby down.
    First came the Duchess of HAMPTONSHIRE followed at an interval
    by Lady MOTTISFONT and the Marchioness of STONEHENGE. To them
    succeeded BARBARA of the House of GREBE, Lady ICENWAY and
    Squire PETRICK's lady. Next followed the Countess of WESSEX,
    the Honourable LAURA and the Lady PENELOPE. ANNA, Lady BAXBY,
    brought up the rear.</p>

    <p>BONDUCA shuddered at the terrible rencounter. Was her young
    life to be surrounded with infants? She was not a baby-farm
    after all, and the audition of these squalling nurslings vexed
    her. What could the matter mean? No answer was given to these
    questionings. A man's figure, vast and terrible, appeared on
    the hill's brow, with a cruel look of triumph on his wicked
    face. It was THOMAS TATTERS. BONDUCA cowered; the noble dames
    fled shrieking down the valley.</p>

    <p>"Bo," said he, "my own sweet Bo, behold the blood-red ray in
    the spectrum of your young life."</p>

    <p>"Say those words quickly," she retorted.</p>

    <p>"Certainly," said TATTERS. "Blood-red ray, Broo-red ray,
    Broo-re-ray, Brooray! Tush!" he broke off, vexed with BONDUCA
    and his own imperfect tongue-power, "you are fooling me.
    Beware!"</p>

    <p>"I know you, I know you!" was all she could gasp, as she
    bowed herself submissive before him. "I detest you, and shall
    therefore marry you. Trample upon me!" And he trampled upon
    her.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

    <p>Thus BO PEEP lost her sheep, leaving these fleecy
    tail-bearers to come home solitary to the accustomed fold. She
    did but humble herself before the manifestation of a Wessex
    necessity.</p>

    <p>And Fate, sitting aloft in the careless expanse of ether
    rolled her destined chariots thundering along the pre-ordained
    highways of heaven, crushing a soul here and a life there with
    the tragic completeness of a steam-roller, granite-smashing,
    steam-fed, irresistible. And butter was churned with a twang in
    it, and rustics danced, and sheep that had fed in clover were
    "blasted," like poor BONDUCA's budding prospects. And, from the
    calm nonchalance of a Wessex hamlet, another novel was launched
    into a world of reviews, where the multitude of readers is not
    as to their external displacements, but as to their subjective
    experiences.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 25.</i>&mdash;Session
    resumed to-day after Easter Recess. As TENNYSON somewhere says,
    Session comes but Members linger. Not forty present when
    business commenced. "May as well go on." said the SPEAKER, whom
    everybody glad to see looking brisk and hearty after his
    holiday. "They'll drop in by-and-by."</p>

    <p>So they did, but without evidence of overmastering haste or
    enthusiasm. Only half-dozen questions on paper; very early got
    to business in Committee on Indian Councils Bill; supposed to
    be measure involving closest interests of the great empire that
    CLIVE helped to make, and SEYMOUR KEAY now looks after.
    Appearance of House suggestive rather of some local question
    affecting Isle of Sheppey or Romney Marsh. Below Gangway, on
    Ministerial side, only MACLEAN present. Member for Oldham a
    sizeable man, but seemed a little lost in space. Above Gangway
    RICHARD TEMPLE on guard. Prince ARTHUR and GEORGIE CURZON had
    Treasury Bench all to themselves. Opportunity for observing how
    cares of office are beginning to tell on GEORGE. Growing quite
    staid in manner, the weight of India adding gravity to his
    looks, sicklying his young face o'er with pale cast of thought.
    Pretty to see him blush to-night when SEYMOUR KEAY made
    graceful allusion to his genius and statesmanlike conduct of
    affairs. "Approbation from Sir HUBERT STANLEY," as he later
    observed, "is praise indeed."</p>

    <p>Only sign of life and movement displayed below and above
    Gangway opposite. SCHWANN evidently in running for BRADLAUGH's
    vacant place as Member for India. Fortunate in finding a party
    brimful of energy, enthusiasm, eloquence, and encyclopædic
    knowledge&mdash;MORTON, SEYMOUR KEAY, SAM SMITH, JULIUS
    'ANNIBAL PICTON, SWIFT MACNEILL, and the CURSE OF CAMBORNE, who
    has been as far East as the Cape, and therefore knows all about
    India.</p>

    <p>Some Members looking across the waste place behind MACLEAN
    whilst he was delivering vigorous speech, thought of poor LEWIS
    PELLY, who really knew something about India, and therefore
    would probably not have spoken had he been here to-night. A
    kindly, courteous, upright, valiant gentleman, who took a
    little too seriously the joke House had with him about the
    Mombasa business. Everyone recalls his luminous speech on the
    question, with its graphic description of forced marches "from
    So-and-so to So-on," dubious nights by night "from Etcetera to
    So-forth."</p>

    <p>PELLY was with us when the House adjourned. In recess he,
    too, has made a forced march, passing from the ordinary So-on
    into the unmapped So-forth.</p>

    <p>MACLEAN's speech stirred up the dolorous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"
       id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span> desolate House. Only one
       other movement. This when SEYMOUR KEAY, in one of several
       speeches dropped the remark, "I am sure my friends near me
       will bear me out when I say&mdash;" Instant commotion below
       Gangway. SWIFT MACNEILL on his legs; SCHWANN tumbling over
       PICTON; CONYBEARE cannoning against MORTON. All animated by
       desire to take up KEAY and carry him forth. He breathlessly
       explained that it was merely a figure of speech, and, they
       reluctantly resuming their seats, he went on to the bitter
       end.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Practically none.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Amid the pomps and vanities of a
    wicked world there is something refreshing and reassuring in
    spectacle of SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE going about his daily
    business. One would describe him as childlike and bland, only
    for recollection that combination of harmless endearing epithet
    has been applied in another connection and might be
    misunderstood. A pity, for there are no other words that so
    accurately describe SAGE's manner when, just now, he rose to
    pose Prince ARTHUR with awkward question about Dissolution.
    Wanted to know whether, supposing Parliament dissolved between
    months of September and December in present year, a Bill would
    be brought in to accelerate Registration? Terms of question
    being set forth on printed paper, not necessary for the SAGE to
    recite them. For this he seemed grateful. It relieved him from
    the pain of appearing to embarrass Prince ARTHUR by a reference
    to awkward matters. No one could feel acutely hurt at being
    asked "Question No. 8." So the SAGE, half rising from his
    seat&mdash;so delicate was his forbearance, that he would not
    impose his full height on the eyesight of the
    Minister&mdash;"begged to ask the FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY
    Question No. 8."</p>

    <p>Quite charming Prince ARTHUR's start of surprise when he
    looked at the paper and saw, as if for the first time, the
    question addressed to him. Dear me! here was a Member actually
    wanting to know something about the date of the Dissolution,
    and what would follow in certain contingencies. As a
    philosopher, Prince ARTHUR was familiar with the vagaries of
    the average mind. He could not prevent the SAGE, in his large
    leisure, untrammelled by no other consideration than that of
    doing the greatest amount of good to the largest number,
    indulging in speculations. But for Her Majesty's Ministers, the
    contingency referred to was so remote and uncertain, that they
    had not even contemplated taking any steps to meet it.</p>

    <p>Then might the SAGE assume that, if the contingency arose,
    the Government would act in the manner he had suggested?</p>

    <p>No; on the whole, Prince ARTHUR, thinking the matter over in
    full view of the House, concluded the SAGE might hardly draw
    that deduction from what he had said.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The House, having listened intently to this artless
    conversation, proceeded to business of the day, which happily
    included the adoption of a Resolution engaging the Government
    to connect with the mainland, by telephone or telegraph, the
    lighthouses and lightships that twinkle round our stormy
    coasts. It was Cap'n BIRKBECK who moved this Resolution,
    seconded from other side in admirable speech by
    MARJORIBANKS.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Excellent.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Much surprised, strolling down to
    House this afternoon, to find place in sort of state of siege.
    Policemen, policemen everywhere, and, as one sadly observed,
    "not a drop to drink." Haven't seen anything like it since
    KENEALY used to shake the dewdrops from his mane as he walked
    through Palace Yard, passing through enthusiastic crowd into
    House of Commons, perspiring after his efforts in Old
    Westminster Courts. Later, when BRADLAUGH used to-give dear old
    GOSSET waltzing lessons, pirouetting between Bar and Table,
    scene was somewhat similar.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter. HORSLEY?" I asked, coming across our
    able and indefatigable Superintendent striding about the
    Corridor, as NAPOLEON visited the outposts on the eve of
    Austerlitz.</p>

    <p>"It's them Women, Sir," he said. "Perhaps you've heard of
    them at St. James's Hall last night? Platform stormed; Chairman
    driven off at point of bodkin; Reporters' table crumpled up;
    party of the name of BURROWS seized by the throat and laid on
    the flat of his back."</p>

    <p>"A position, I should say, not peculiarly convenient for
    oratorical effort. But you seem to have got new men at the
    various posts?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir," said Field-Marshal HORSLEY. lowering his voice
    to whisper; "we've picked em out. Gone through the Force;
    mustered all the bald-headed men. They say that at conclusion
    of argument on Woman's Suffrage in St. James's Hall last night,
    floor nearly ankle-deep in loose hair. They don't get much off
    <i>my</i> men," said HORSLEY, proudly.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:15%;">
        <a href="images/228-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/228-2.png"
             alt="'So young and so iniquitous!'" /></a>"So young
             and so iniquitous!"
    </div>

    <p>Very well, I suppose, to take those precautions. Probably
    they had something to do with the almost disappointing result.
    Everything passed off as quietly as if subject-matter of Debate
    had been India, or Vote in Committee of Supply of odd Million
    or two. Ladies locked up in Cage over SPEAKER's Chair, with
    lime-lights playing on placards hung on walls enforcing
    "Silence!" Cunningly arranged that SAM SMITH should come on
    early with speech. This lasted full hour, and had marvellously
    sedative effect. Some stir in Gallery when, later, ASQUITH
    demolished Bill with merciless logic. Through the iron bars,
    that in this case make a Cage, there came, as he spoke, a
    shrill whisper, "So young and so iniquitous!" Prince ARTHUR,
    dexterously intervening, soothed the angry breast by his
    chivalrous advocacy of Woman's Rights. As he resumed his seat
    there floated over the charmed House, coming "So young and so
    as it were from heavenly spheres above the iniquitous!"
    SPEAKER's Chair, a cooing whisper, "What a love of a man!"</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Woman's Suffrage Bill rejected
    by 175 Votes against 152.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Little sparring match between
    Front Benches. Mr. G. and all his merry men anxious, above all
    things, to know when Dissolution will dawn? SQUIRE OF MALWOOD
    starts inquiry. Prince ARTHUR interested, but ignorant. Can't
    understand why people should always be talking about
    Dissolution. Here we have best of all Ministries, a sufficient
    majority, an excellent programme, and barely reached the month
    of May. Why can't we get on with our work, and cease indulgence
    in these wild imaginings? Next week, on BLANE's Motion, there
    will be opportunity for Mr. G. to explain his Home Rule scheme.
    Let him contentedly look forward to pasturing on that joy, and
    not trouble his head about indefinite details like
    Dissolutions.</p>

    <p>This speech the best thing Prince ARTHUR has done since he
    became Leader.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
